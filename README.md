# Stock-Analysis
### Overview of the Project
   This project's purpose was to refactor code used to analyze stocks in order to make it run faster. 
  The code needs to be refractored because its purpose was originally intended to analyze a few dozen stocks but it may not be useful or may take to long to run when the entire stock market is included. 
  The original code took around an entire second to finish running and after the changes that time was cut down to around .15 seconds. 
  ### Results
   When comparing the results of the two codes there is a very clear benefit to using the new refactored code. 
   The speed of the new code is significantly faster. Where the original code took around a second to complete the new code is done within .15 seconds. This is a significant change in speed.
   When more stock data is added to the worksheet this code will be much better at handling a larger amount
